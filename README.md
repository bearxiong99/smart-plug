Energy Consumption Meter with freeRTOS

A wireless low-energy consumption meter. Plugged into a socket, you can read the energy consumption of any attached device using a smart phone. In order to keep the energy consumption of the Smart Plug to a minimum, an ARM-Cortex M3 microcontroller and a Nordic nRF8001 Bluetooth low-energy chip was utilized. To allow simultaneous data measuring and data exchange between the devices, freeRTOS was used. The micro-controller was programmed in C.
